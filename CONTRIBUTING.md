## Setting up your dev environment

- Fork this repo to your github profile
- Clone the forked repo from your github profile
- Create your branch (example name: `sub-branch`)
- Check out to the branch you created and write your code.
- It is very important that you confirm you are not committing directly to the main branch to help manage changes
- Always check main remote repo to sync your forked repo with main repo to stay upto date.
- Whenever you finish coding or before coding, make sure to run `git pull --rebase origin main` to rebase your local changes to be up to date with remote repo
- In cases of conflict, please reach out to confirm you are not making breaking changes or merge with care to resolve conflict
- After pushing your code to your forked repo, make a pull request so your changes would be merged.

- Use `pnpm` to install packages.

- To run this project in development, run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies and dev-dependencies, and `pnpm run dev` to start the server.

```bash
pnpm install

pnpm dev
```

- Take your time to observe the structure of the codebase so that you would align with the file system. It a folder already exists for what you want to do, kindly create the file in that folder rather than duplicating the folder.

## Colors

Currently, main colors are as follows and should be consistent in any component a Frontend Developer is working on.

- Text-light mode: text-black,
- Text-dark mode: text-white
- border: border-blue-500. ...recommend you check out extisting implementation on inputs and container borders
- icons should be SVG and I remmend you paste and export raw SVG in the icons component - check out for the icons.tsx file. Color recommended for svg is `text-blue-500`, hover state can be `text-blue-600`.

`blue-500` = `#3B82F6` = `rgb(59, 130, 246, 100)`
`blue-600` = `#2563EB` = `rgb(37, 99, 235, 100)`

```bash
:root {
  --foreground-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
  --background-start-rgb: 214, 219, 220;
  --background-end-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --foreground-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
    --background-start-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
    --background-end-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
  }
}

body {
  color: rgb(var(--foreground-rgb));
  background: linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      transparent,
      rgb(var(--background-end-rgb))
    )
    rgb(var(--background-start-rgb));
}
```
